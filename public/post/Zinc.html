<p><em>A comprehensive review for a science‑and‑technology audience</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element that participates in more than 300 enzymatic reactions and plays pivotal roles in cellular proliferation, signal transduction, gene expression, and immune competence. Although required only in minute amounts—approximately 8 mg/day for adult women and 11 mg/day for adult men—the importance of maintaining adequate zinc status cannot be overstated. This review synthesises current evidence on the physiological functions of zinc, its health benefits, clinical manifestations of deficiency, and dietary strategies to optimise intake.</p>

<h3 id="31-immune-modulation">3.1 Immune Modulation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Innate Immunity</strong>: Zinc deficiency impairs neutrophil function, reduces natural killer (NK) cell activity, and weakens barrier defenses in mucosal tissues.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive Immunity</strong>: T‑cell proliferation is zinc‑dependent; low levels skew the Th1/Th2 balance toward a pro‑inflammatory profile.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="32-antioxidant-protection">3.2 Antioxidant Protection</h3>
<p>Zinc’s participation in Cu/Zn‑SOD confers protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Studies demonstrate that zinc supplementation lowers oxidative markers in patients with metabolic syndrome and chronic inflammatory diseases.</p>
<h3 id="33-neurocognitive-function">3.3 Neurocognitive Function</h3>
<p>Neurotransmitter synthesis, particularly dopamine and glutamate, requires zinc. Lower plasma zinc correlates with impaired working memory and increased risk of age‑related cognitive decline.</p>
<h3 id="34-wound-healing--dermatology">3.4 Wound Healing &amp; Dermatology</h3>
<p>Zinc promotes keratinocyte proliferation and collagen cross‑linking. Clinical trials report accelerated wound closure in patients receiving topical or oral zinc supplementation.</p>
<h3 id="35-reproductive-health">3.5 Reproductive Health</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Male Fertility</strong>: Zinc stabilises sperm chromatin and protects against oxidative DNA damage.</li>
<li><strong>Female Hormonal Balance</strong>: Adequate zinc is necessary for follicular development; deficiency may contribute to menstrual irregularities.</li>

<h2 id="6-strategies-to-optimize-zinc-status">6. Strategies to Optimize Zinc Status</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Balanced Diet</strong> – Combine animal and plant proteins; include legumes, nuts, and seeds in regular meals.</li>
<li><strong>Food Processing Techniques</strong> – Soaking, sprouting, or fermenting legumes and grains improves bioavailability.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Excessive Calcium &amp; Iron</strong> – High intakes can competitively inhibit zinc absorption.</li>
<li><strong>Consider Supplements Only When Needed</strong> – In high‑risk groups (pregnant women, elderly, vegans), a 15–30 mg/day supplement may be warranted under medical supervision.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="7-conclusion">7. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Zinc’s integral role across cellular and systemic pathways underscores its importance for maintaining health. Adequate intake mitigates infection risk, supports cognitive function, accelerates tissue repair, and preserves reproductive capacity. Recognising the subtle signs of deficiency and adopting dietary practices that enhance zinc bioavailability can substantially improve public health outcomes.</p>
